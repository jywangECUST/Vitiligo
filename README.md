Vitiligo is a complex disorder characterized by the loss of pigment in the skin. The current therapeutic strategies are limited. The identification of novel drug targets and candidates is highly challenging for vitiligo. In this study, we designed a systematic framework to discover potential therapeutic targets for vitiligo via combining machine learning and network analysis together. With the framework, we had successfully predicted and experimentally validated that some potential therapeutic targets such as CDK1 and PBK were closely related to melanogenesis, and further explored the multi-target strategy of kaempferide for vitiligo through proteomics profiling. The strategy mainly included (i) the suppression of the p38 MAPK signaling pathway by inhibiting CDK1 and PBK, and (ii) the modulation of cellular redox homeostasis, especially TXN and GSH antioxidant pathways, for the purpose of melanogenesis. Meanwhile, this strategy was a novel perspective to discover novel drug candidates for vitiligo. Thus, the framework would be a useful tool to discover potential therapeutic strategies and drug candidates for complex diseases.
